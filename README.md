# Project Name: Stock Trading AI Chatbot

## Description

This project is a stock trading AI chatbot that uses machine learning algorithms, such as **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**, to make investment decisions based on stock market predictions. The chatbot provides advice on whether to invest in a particular stock and explains the reasoning behind each decision.

The AI model is trained using historical stock data, and the bot uses **Polygon.io** API to fetch real-time stock prices. Itâ€™s designed to be deployed on Google Cloud with Flask or FastAPI for backend functionality.

## Features

- Predict stock prices using machine learning models (LSTM)
- Advise whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock
- Provide explanations for the decisions made
- Deployable on Google Cloud using **Flask/FastAPI**
- Interacts with users via a chatbot interface

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language for building the chatbot and model
- **TensorFlow / Keras**: For training LSTM models
- **Polygon.io API**: For fetching real-time stock market data
- **Flask / FastAPI**: For deploying the model as an API
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application
- **Google Cloud**: For cloud-based deployment
- **GitHub**: For version control
